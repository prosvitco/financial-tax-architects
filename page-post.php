    						<p>What our firm does is quite unique. When we deal with tax planning we hit on a number of different topics (many unique) to make sure we are being PROACTIVE not REACTIVE when it comes to tax planning.
For many people, funding a tax deferred 401(k) or IRA can be more tax hostile than tax favorable. Most people are unaware of a tax-free retirement tool that can be a much better retirement tool then tax-deferred plans.</p>

                            <p>Our firm is unique because we always put our client’s needs first. That may seem like an obvious statement, but as we’ve found out when reviewing several new client’s previous advice, many times the advice advisors give is what’s best for them and not their clients.

Our firm prides itself in its knowledge on a broad spectrum of concepts and products. Even so, we know it is impossible for one person or one firm to know it all. That is why we have strategic alliances with some of the top law firms in the country as well as other top experts in the finance and insurance fields.

Our goal is to be “the” place a client can turn to get answers/help on asset protection, income, estate, and capital gains tax reduction, growing wealth in the least risky manner possible, estate planning, business/corporate planning issues and much more.

We hope you enjoy our web-site and find time to both read various parts of the site as well as watch several of the educational presentations.</p>

    						<p>Tax planning means different things to different people.</p>
    						<ul>
                                <li>A CPA/accountant/EA typically thinks of tax planning as doing a tax return for a client and sending them the bill for the taxes due. Some might recommend a SEP IRA or SIMPLE Plan, but they typically do not deal with real tax planning</li>
                                <li>An attorney thinks of tax planning as doing someone’s living trusts so the client can maximize estate tax exemptions</li>
                                <li>A financial planner/insurance advisor typically thinks of tax planning as the use of a 401(k) plan.</li>
                            </ul>
